Task: CDN Integration Prototype

Objective: The objective of this task is to assess the candidate's ability to integrate a CDN using Kong and Python. The task should be completed within a day or two.

Requirements:

CDN Integration:
Set up Kong API Gateway as a reverse proxy to handle CDN functionality for a web application.
Demonstrate the configuration and functionality of Kong as a CDN, without implementing caching.

Asset Upload and Retrieval:
Implement Python functions that simulate the CDN upload and retrieval processes through the Kong API.
The upload function should take a file path as input, simulate the upload process, and generate a unique CDN URL for the uploaded asset.

The retrieval function should take an asset filename as input, simulate the retrieval process, and return a mock CDN URL for the requested asset.

Note: The candidate should submit their code implementation, along with any necessary instructions for setting up and running the prototype
